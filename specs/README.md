# Specs Directory

This is where you'll create your spec files for Task 2!

## What is a Spec?

A spec (specification) is a document that describes what you want to build.
Instead of writing code directly, you describe the requirements and let Kiro implement it.

## Example Spec Structure

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Overview
Brief description of what this feature does

## Requirements
1. Requirement 1
2. Requirement 2
3. Requirement 3

## User Flow
1. User does X
2. System does Y
3. User sees Z

## Technical Details
- API endpoints to call
- State management needed
- Error handling approach
- UI components required

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Requirement 1 is met
- [ ] Requirement 2 is met
- [ ] Feature works end-to-end
```

## For Task 2

Create `duck-generator-feature.md` in this directory and describe:
- What the duck generator should do
- How users interact with it
- What happens when they click "Generate"
- How to display the generated duck
- How to handle errors

Then ask Kiro to implement it from your spec!
