# Kiro Configuration Directory

This directory contains Kiro-specific configuration files.

## Subdirectories

### steering/
Steering docs define coding standards and conventions that Kiro will follow.
You'll create `duck-standards.md` here for Task 1.

### hooks/
Agent hooks define automated actions that trigger on events (like file save).
You'll create a validation hook here for Task 3.

## For Participants

Don't worry about creating these folders manually - Kiro will create them
when you ask it to create steering docs or hooks!
