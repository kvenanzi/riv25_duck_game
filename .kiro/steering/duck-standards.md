# Duck Coding Standards 🦆

These standards apply to this project to keep everything delightfully duck‑themed and consistent.

## API Function Naming
- All API functions must use duck‑themed names (e.g., `quackFetch`, `waddle`, `hatchDuck`, `fetchDuckling`).
- Avoid generic names like `getData`, `fetchApi`, etc.

## Prompt Requirements
- All prompts sent to AI models must explicitly include the word **"duck"**.
- If a user description does not include "duck", enhance or rewrite the prompt so that it does.

## Error Messaging
- All error messages should be encouraging and duck‑themed.
- Prefer light, playful language (e.g., "Quack! Something ruffled my feathers, please try again.").
- Errors should guide the user on what to do next, not just state that something went wrong.

## Async API Usage
- Use `async`/`await` for all asynchronous API calls.
- Prefer `try`/`catch` for error handling around API calls, with duck‑themed error messages surfaced to the user.
